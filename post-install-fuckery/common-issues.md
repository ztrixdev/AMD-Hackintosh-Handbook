# Common Issues

Ryzentoshes are DAMN not as stable as Intel Hackintoshes, leave alone real Macs.

Common issues that occur after a successful installation include:

* [Sleep not working](../setting-up-sleep-+-ryzenpatch-script.md) (PC not waking up after falling asleep)
* [Virtualization not working](../how-to-run-virtualbox.md) (f.e, the Android Emulator in Android Studio)
* [MKL-relying apps crash](../discord-freaking-out.md) (Excel, Unity, Discord)
* Random crashes

If you experience an issue that is not listed here - complain in the AMD-OSX Discord server and ping me (ztrixdev is the username) or in my #amd-hackintosh forum on Discord
